      <!--not needed at the moment <p>We are often over subscribed for events, so please note your space is only confirmed once you have been sent an invoice and you have paid it. If we have not sent you an invoice we will let you know that there are no spaces, however we will keep you on a waiting list and let you know if there are any unexpected spaces available. If you have not received a space this time please please please apply again, we like to have a variety of different stalls, so you are probably not offered a space because too many applicants make similar products to you, and we would love to have you at another event.</p>-->
