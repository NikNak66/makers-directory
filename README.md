# makers-directory-proto
A prototype for an online directory of creatives in South East London

## The purpose of the project
This is part of my final project for my university course. This is the first build stage of the project, I built a prototype of the website as I wanted to create my own wordpress theme.

## Why the project is useful
I could collect and use real data so that I could test and review the website with some users before building the wordpress theme.
